# WebZ API v0.9 beta ([Pedesis](https://www.pinterest.com/teremterem/pedesis-from-ancient-greek-a-leaping/))

WebZ API serves two purposes:
 1. At one hand it let's us develop new WebZ Filters which we can then plug into [WebZ Server](https://github.com/terems-org/webz-server#webz-server-v09-beta-pedesis) and have some of our serverside java functionality in place.
 2. At the other hand it also allows us to extend the other side of the server - implement custom file sources which can be adapters for external storages like Dropbox, adapters for SCM providers like GitHub (simple Git adapters) or even some "synthetic" file sources the data for which may even originally not be structured as a file system.
