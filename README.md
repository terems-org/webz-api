# WebZ API v0.9 beta ([Pedesis](https://www.pinterest.com/teremterem/pedesis-from-ancient-greek-a-leaping/))

WebZ API serves two purposes:
 1. At one hand it let's us develop new WebZ Filters which we can then plug into WebZ Server and have some of our serverside java functionality in place.
 2. At the other hand it also allows us to extends the other side of the server - implement custom file sources which can be adapters to external storages like Dropbox, SCMs like GitHub or even some "synthetic" file systems the data for which may sometimes even not be originally structured as a file system.
